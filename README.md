# mentacheck


<b>Description:</b>
Its an app that allows users to track their daily mental health. 

The inspiration came from my own experience where I notice that every 4 weeks I would have an off-day where I would feel lethargic and not be able to get anything done. If we can understand the patterns of our mood, we can priotize rest and relaxation on those off-days to recharge our bodies sufficiently.

By entering their daily moods into a mentalcheck, users will be able to visualise their mood patterns and take preventive actions, such as seeing as a professional when mood is constantly low the past 30 days or schedule a short break on off-days.
